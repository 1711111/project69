        Since machines are way faster than humans, certain tasks that may require an incredible amount of manual work and attention to detail can be easily accomplished with the help of technology. Technology also ensures improved accuracy. Further, the use of technology in certain areas can also help save significant costs. Hence in Wek we believe that it is worth everything in order to teach and help our students master the use of technology. In Gems Wellington Academy Al Khail, we invest our time and money into training our pupils and student in order to manage the latest tech in this fast-moving world. 
        Along with our professionally certified panel of teachers and staff members we commit ourselves in advancing technology and teaching the student in the most efficent 
        ways possible. In the past 10 years of the Academy we have constantly upgraded the tech from the auiditorium to the labs dramatically. Even though are technology are 
        all at the latest, in order to cope with the fast-moving world today we still upgrade our technology frequently. Recently we received an order of a newly released set 
        of robotic kits which almost no other school in Dubai has.
